                <p>
                    I'm a software engineer with a keen interest in backend development. I enjoy solving complex
                    problems and making things work.

                    I am talented in making REST api's, working with Java, JavaScript and Python, and work well in agile environments.

                    Currently seeking my first opportunity to break into the tech industry and join an awesome team and contribute to great projects.
